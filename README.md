Quantitative   Reasoning   (MATH-102-M001)
Syllabus
Course Description
The course covers   mathematical and   statistical   ideas which are essential   to   understanding   quantitative   situations. These   ideas   are:
.      Proportional   and   fractional   contexts   (ratios,   rates,   unit   conversions,   etc.)
.      Estimation and   Precision
.         Modeling
.      Statistics
.      Finance
Each   of   these   ideas   are   presented   and   assessed   in   real-life   situations   so   that   students   can   connect them   to   their   life.

Course MaterialsCourse   materials   are   available   within   the   course.   Because   the   course   is   administered   entirely   online,   you   must   have   access   to   a   computer   to   complete   it.   Exams   are   also   online   and   must   be   taken   at   an    approved   test   proctoring   service   where   you   will   be   required   to   show   photo   identification.There   is   no   need   to   purchase   any   particular   book   or   resource   for   this   course. The   materials   on   this    course   site   are   copyrighted   and   permitted   for   use   under   the   TEACH   Act   only   for   the   use   of   students enrolled   in   this   course   for   purposes   associated   with   this   course   and   may   not   be   retained   or   further    disseminated.
Assignments
You   will   complete   the   following   assignments   during   the   course.   See   the   Grades   page   for   a   breakdown of   assignment   weig代 写MATH 102 Quantitative ReasoningJava

Lesson   quizzes
Each   unit   is   made   up of a   number of lessons and   each   lesson   has   an   associated   quiz.Each quiz will   have about   5 questions on   the   material   from   that   unit. You   may   re-take   a   lesson   quiz   up to   five   times   if   you   are   unhappy   with   the   score   you   get. The   highest   score   you   receive   will   count   toward your   final   grade.   Note   that   questions   will   be   randomly   selected   from   a   bank   of   questions   when   you   re-      take   a   lesson   quiz.   In   other   words, you   will   get   an   entirely   different   set   of   questions.
Projects
There   will   be   a   project   for   each   unit.
The   projects   will   require   that   you   apply   the   quantitative   reasoning   concepts   from   the   unit   to   address   a real-life   quantitative   problem   or   question   that   you   face.   In   some   cases, you   will   have   complete   control over   the   substance   of   the   problem   that   you   address   and   will   only   be   limited   by   the   concepts   in   the
unit.   In   other   cases, we   have   identified   a   universal   problem   that   all   students   will   address   using   the unique   circumstances   of   their   own   life.   Each   project   will   be   worth   20   points.
Proctored   Midcourse   and   Final   Exams
There   is   a   proctored   midcourse   exam   and   a   proctored   final   exam. You   may   use   one   of   the   calculators provided   on-screen   in   the   tests   or   you   may   bring   your   own   calculator   but   not   the   calculator   on   your       cell   phone   or   programmable/graphing   calculators. You   may   also   bring   and   use   blank   scratch   paper
that   must   be   surrendered   to   the   proctor   or   destroyed   upon   completion   of   the   exam—whether   or   not you   wrote   on   it.
Calculators and Internet   Usage
Lesson   Quizzes   and   Unit   Tests
Because   the   purpose   of   this   course   is   to   help   you   use   quantitative   reasoning   in   everyday   life,   and
because   everyday   life   grants   you   access   to   calculators   and   the   internet, we   will   not   restrict   usage   of either   of   these   resources   on   the   lesson   quizzes   or   unit   tests.   You   may   use   your   phone,   the   internet,   and   any   type   of   calculator   for   these   assessments.
Proctored   Midcourse   and   Final   Exams
Your   resources   are   restricted   on   the   proctored   exams. As   mentioned   above, you   may   bring   your   own calculator,   but   you   may   not   use   the   calculator   on   your   cell   phone   or   a   programmable/graphing
calculator.   In   some   test   questions, you   will   be   provided   a   link   to   a   particular   website—you   will   only have   access   to   those   websites,   not   the   entire   internet.
Grading
Your   grade   in   this   course   will   be   based   on   these   assignments   and   exams.
